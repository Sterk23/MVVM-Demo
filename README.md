# MVVM Demo app
This repo I've learned from https://resocoder.com/2018/09/07/mvvm-on-android-crash-course-kotlin-android-architecture-components/ most of 90% of this repo is the same with that link (except some deprecated function)

What I have to learn next
* Change from FakeDB to use Room
* Use daager2  for DI
